    "This notebook is intended to demonstrate the methodology used by the Devex Analytics team to arrive at total figures for funding channeled by 20 different donor institutions to the \"thematic area\" of *entrepreneurship and small-and-growing businesses*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology uses data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). The full methodology used to create the figures in the Devex report summed the figures from this methodology, as well as other figures found through additional desk research. Thus this methodology does not represent a complete data collection process. However, the code and descriptions here illustrate well the process followed for IATI data, and the human decisions made about how to analyse that data. For donors that do *not* consistently contribute quality data to IATI, additional collection, processing, and analysis will be required."
