Malaria is widely recognized to be a major public health priority in Afghanistan requiring continued international assistance.  The disease is endemic in large areas below 2000 meters in elevation and is highly prevalent in river valleys used for rice cultivation. With an estimated population of 26.1 million in 2007 (WHO), approximately 80% of whom live in rural areas, it has been estimated that the annual incidence approaches 1.25 million cases per year .  Recognizing the unacceptable burden this places on the health and economic development of the nation, the Government and the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) are firmly committed to the control of the disease.  In this context, the MoPH and the National Malaria and Leishmaniasis Control Programme (NMLCP) have endorsed the Global and Regional Roll Back Malaria (RBM) strategies and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  In support of this program, a detailed Gap Analysis was conducted in March 2008 and a revised National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP) was developed for 2008-2013.

The current program is based on the revised Strategic Plan 2008-2013, considering the funding provided by the Global Fund in Round 5. 

A comprehensive spectrum of activities shall be carried out to achieve the stated Goal and Objectives of the NMSP.  These initiatives will sustain and expand the set of activities supported during the Global Fund Round 5 grant period and propose innovative approaches to accelerate Programme implementation.  Key strategies include improving access to early diagnostic services by expanding the network of laboratory services to rural areas, introducing Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) at the community level, upgrading case management policies through revised evidence-based National Treatment Guidelines (NTGs) and promoting their proper utilization in both the public and private sectors, engaging Community Health Workers (CHWs) to provide Home-based Management of Malaria (HMM), utilizing new distribution modalities to provide free long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs), activating creative Behavioural Change Communications (BCC) modalities to improve awareness and promote behaviour change, and strengthening Quality Assurance mechanisms in all aspects of Programme implementation.  Specific measures will address efforts for the prompt detection and control of epidemics, to improve Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities and to strengthen Programme capacity to sustain this ambitious set of initiatives. Selected operational research activities have been designed to add to the scientific basis for continued strategic planning and to implement an aggressive integrated set of carefully-planned interventions to eliminate Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) from the border areas of Tajikistan.

In addition to expanding services to females, special attention will be given to targeting Programme interventions in known risk areas and the vulnerable populations of pregnant women, children under five-years of age and populations in remote rural areas, often under-served by existing public sector health facilities.  Particular emphasis will be placed on increasing access to the key affected populations of refugees returning from neighboring countries (Returnees), Internally-Displaced Populations (IDPs) and nomads.

The Programme also includes three ""cross-cutting"" measures for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS), that will be implemented by the MoPH, to enhance health data management and use, to expand high quality early malaria and tuberculosis laboratory services in rural areas and to initiate a new Community Health Nursing  programme.

The Round 8 program will be implemented by three Principal Recipients, namely the MoPH, HealthNet TPO (HN-TPO), and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee /Afghanistan (BRAC Afghanistan).

Malaria is widely recognized to be a major public health priority in Afghanistan requiring continued international assistance.  The disease is endemic in large areas below 2000 metres in elevation and is highly prevalent in river valleys used for rice cultivation. With an estimated population of 26.1 million in 2007 (WHO), approximately 80% of whom live in rural areas, it has been estimated that the annual incidence approaches 1.25 million cases per year .  Recognizing the unacceptable burden this places on the health and economic development of the nation, the Government and the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) are firmly committed to the control of the disease.  In this context, the MoPH and the National Malaria and Leishmaniasis Control Programme (NMLCP) have endorsed the Global and Regional Roll Back Malaria (RBM) strategies and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  In support of this program,, a detailed Gap Analysis was conducted in March 2008 and a revised National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP) was developed for 2008-2013.

Resistance to anti-TB drugs represents a serious obstacle to effective control of the TB epidemic in Armenia. The Program has two main objectives: to strengthen the National TB Control Program to provide better diagnostics and treatment, including the scale-up of the management of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) in the country by enrolling over a thousand multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients over five years from the civilian and penitentiary sectors, and to improve the supportive environment for effective TB control. It aims to strengthen the National TB Control Program in the following areas: procurement and supply management, human resources, MDR-TB and TB diagnostics and case management, social support to TB patients, TB/HIV co-infection, infection control, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy, communication and social mobilization. Its goals are to reduce TB incidence & mortality and prevent the further development of drug-resistant TB by targeting all TB and DR-TB patients.

In addition, malaria control efforts in the southwestern part of the country were complicated by high mobility of the population and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. New malaria cases hit a peak of 13,135 in 1996. This prompted the government to develop the National Malaria Control Program in 1998 in cooperation with World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe. By 2006 Azerbaijan’s malaria situation had improved dramatically, with only 143 new cases reported. Although the incidence is now relatively low - less than one infection per 1,000 people – the threat of renewed outbreaks remains high: 80 percent of the country is considered to be prone to malaria transmission and active foci are reported in many districts. The overall goal of the program the Round 7 grant supports is to reduce the transmission and incidence of P. vivax malaria and to prevent malaria outbreaks. The program is based on the National Malaria Elimination Strategy for the period 2008–2013 and aims to achieve its goals by training health staff in malaria-related planning, epidemic preparedness and monitoring, in line with the WHO's technical guidelines on malaria control and prevention, update existing legislation and regulations on malaria control, upgrade the country's laboratories in order to improve diagnosis of malaria cases and strengthen national capacities for timely response and prevention of malaria outbreaks.",2008-10-01,2013-09-30 00:00:00,2008-10-01,2013-09-30,AZ,Azerbaijan,,12262,Malaria control,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,USD,5474039.0,5474040.0,5310358.0

The programmatic series has three pillars: (i) strengthening fiscal sustainability and self-reliance; (ii) increasing access to finance; and (iii) improving the investment climate and increasing domestic and foreign investment. To realize rapid economic growth, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) continues to focus on five economic jewels: hydropower, agriculture, tourism, cottage and small industries, and mining. Implementation of the development management system has supported poverty reduction and gender equality. To sustain these achievements, two key economic challenges must be addressed: sustaining macroeconomic stability and boosting private-sector development. The high current account deficits are the result of elevated imports associated with the construction of hydropower projects, which are covered by long-term donor financing.

Bhutan is one of the smallest but fastest-growing economies in the world with an annual average growth rate of 7.6 percent over the past three decades. This stellar growth performance has helped improve living standards and has contributed to poverty reduction. However, further welfare improvements will require a dynamic job-creating private sector. The current hydropower driven growth model has created some macroeconomic imbalances and coupled with a large and dominant public sector, impeded the development of a vibrant private sector. As a result, the economy has witnessed considerable volatility, and limited job creation. This DPC series will help the government address some of these challenges by supporting reforms aimed at improving the management of macroeconomic volatility, strengthening domestic resource mobilization, and promoting employment opportunities in the private sector. The DPC series is also consistent with Bhutan's 11th (2013-18) and 12th Five-Year Plans (FYP) (2018-23). To support the government of Bhutan address these challenges, the proposed series aims to strengthen the policy framework to improve fiscal management and enhance policies to promote private sector employment opportunities in Bhutan. The proposed operations are structured around two pillars. The first pillar focuses on actions that strengthen macroeconomic management, domestic resource mobilization and public financial management. This will also contribute to a more stable financial sector that is better able to achieve the objective of the second pillar, which seeks to increase access to finance, for MSMEs.
